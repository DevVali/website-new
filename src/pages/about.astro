			Hello stranger! <Icon

			> or <span class="text-primary">DevVali</span>, and I'm a software engineer passionate
			about web development and open source. Moving in the area of web development from a
			young age, I continued to develop my skills and never stopped learning new things, which
			resulted in accidentally learning the technologies needed to build modern and performant
			websites.
