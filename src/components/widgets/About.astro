<h2 class="text-3xl font-extrabold md:text-4xl">About Me</h2>

<p class="text-xl md:text-2xl">
	Hi, I'm <span class="text-primary">ejvali</span> ðŸ‘‹, a software engineer passionate about <span
		class="text-primary">web development</span
	> and <span class="text-primary">open source</span>. I've been into web development from a young
	age, and I've continued to develop my skills and never stopped learning new things, which
	resulted in learning the technologies needed to build modern and performant websites.
</p>

<p class="text-xl md:text-2xl">
	I've crafted several projects, which you can find on <a
		href="https://github.com/DevVali"
		class="text-primary">my GitHub profile</a
	> or the <a href="#projects" class="text-primary">Projects</a> page on this website. I've also worked
	as a social media manager at <a href="https://www.gluo.xyz" class="text-primary">Gluo</a>.
