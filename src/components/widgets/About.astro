		Hi, I'm <span class="text-primary">ejvali</span> ðŸ‘‹, a software engineer passionate about <span
			class="text-primary">web development</span
		> and <span class="text-primary">open source</span>. I've been into web development from a
		young age, and I've continued to develop my skills and never stopped learning new things,
		which resulted in learning the technologies needed to build modern and performant websites.

	<p class="text-xl md:text-2xl">
		I've crafted several projects, which you can find on <a
